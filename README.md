# What?

These are some of my experiments in what some would call data science and what
I would call having too much time on my hands.

## Installation

You need to either use Nix or NixOS for this. I'm also using `direnv` to
automatically enable and install my packages. If you don't use it, run `nix
shell` and you should be dropped into a working shell with all the required
packages.

## LICENSE
